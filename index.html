      <h2>What Are Hackathons?</h2>
      <p>A hackathon is a focused, time-limited event where people come together to build, learn, and collaborate on
        projects. Events can range from a single day to a few days and usually include team-based work, short problem
        statements, and opportunities to try new ideas.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Why Hackathons Exist</h2>
      <p>Organizers run hackathons to encourage innovation, solve specific problems, and create learning opportunities.
        They bring together diverse people—students, professionals, and hobbyists—to experiment and build quickly in a
        supportive setting.</p>

      <h2>Online vs On-site Hackathons</h2>
      <p>Online hackathons let participants join from anywhere and can be more flexible with schedules. On-site events
        offer in-person collaboration, mentorship, and hands-on workshops. Each format has advantages depending on your
        goals and availability.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Who Can Participate?</h2>
      <p>Beginners are welcome. Hackathons often include developers, designers, product thinkers, and organizers. Teams
        with mixed skills are common and encouraged—there is no requirement to be an expert.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
      <p>Participants build both technical skills (problem-solving, prototyping, version control) and transferable
        skills (communication, planning, pitching ideas). These experiences are useful across many jobs and projects.

      <h2>How Hackathons Impact Careers</h2>
      <p>Hackathons can help you build a portfolio, meet professionals, and practice presenting your work. They are one
        of many ways to gain experience and showcase initiative, but they do not guarantee job offers.</p>
