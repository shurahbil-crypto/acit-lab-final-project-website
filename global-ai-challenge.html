                <h1>Global AI Challenge 2024</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the era of Gemini 3. Google DeepMind is thrilled to invite you to the Global AI Challenge
                    2024. We are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do by enhancing reasoning capabilities, unlocking
                    multimodal experiences and reducing latency. Now, we want to see what you can create with our most
                    capable and intelligent model family to date.</p>

            <h2>Why Participate?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be First:</strong> Get hands-on access to the Gemini 3 API before the rest of the world
                    catches up.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Something New:</strong> This challenge is strictly for new applications. It's a level
                    playing field for everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Win Big:</strong> We have a prize pool of $100,000 + interviews with the AI Futures Fund
                    team for an opportunity to fund your project.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <h3>What to Build</h3>
            <p>The prompt is simple: Build a NEW application using the Gemini 3 API. There are no category restrictions.
                Build a game, a productivity tool, a scientific analyzer, or a robotic controller. If it uses Gemini 3
                to do something cool, we want to see it! For inspiration, check out the Resources tab!</p>

            <h3>What to Submit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Text description describing the Gemini Integration - A brief write-up (~200 words) detailing which
                    Gemini 3 features were used and how they are central to the application.</li>
                <li>Public Project Link: A URL to your working product or interactive demo. Consider using AI Studio
                    apps, which are the fastest way to build prototypes using the Gemini API.</li>
                <li>URL to your PUBLIC code repository - required if you do not have an AI Studio link to your project
                </li>
